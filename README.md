# Lending-Club
This repo will have my work related to learning machine learning with Lending club data. I had some of this work done already but I just learned how to make those pretty IPython notebooks (Anaconda comes with Jupyter) so I'm more excited to share. 

* Start with downloading csv files from Lending Club's Statistics page
* Then run the process csvs script
